# Pomodoro Timer Web App - Step by Step Plan

## 1. Setup Project

- [x] Create a new Phoenix project with LiveView support
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS
- [x] Set up basic project structure
- [ ] Create the main layout

## 2. Design Data Model

- [ ] Define data structures to track:
  - [ ] Current mode (focus, break, etc.)
  - [ ] Timer duration (25 minutes for focus, 5 minutes for break)
  - [ ] Current timer value
  - [ ] Timer status (running, paused, stopped)

## 3. Create Timer Core Logic

- [ ] Design a Timer context to handle the timer functionality
- [ ] Implement functions to:
  - [ ] Start the timer
  - [ ] Pause the timer
  - [ ] Reset the timer
  - [ ] Handle timer completion
  - [ ] Switch between Focus and Break modes

## 4. Implement LiveView Component

- [ ] Create a LiveView module for the timer
- [ ] Set up the initial state with default values (25:00)
- [ ] Implement mount and handle_event callbacks
- [ ] Create a timer update mechanism (using Process.send_after for second-by-second updates)
- [ ] Define event handlers for user actions (start, pause, reset)

## 5. Design UI with Tailwind CSS

- [ ] Create a clean, centered layout
- [ ] Design the timer display with large, readable numbers
- [ ] Create buttons for controlling the timer (Focus, Break, Reset)
- [ ] Add visual feedback for current timer state
- [ ] Implement responsive design

## 6. Add Interactivity

- [ ] Connect UI buttons to LiveView events
- [ ] Implement real-time updates of the timer display
- [ ] Add visual and audio indicators for timer completion
- [ ] Implement smooth transitions between states

## 7. Advanced Features (for future iterations)

- [ ] Session tracking for completed Pomodoros
- [ ] Customizable timer durations
- [ ] Task list integration
- [ ] Statistics and reports
- [ ] User accounts to save preferences

## 8. Testing

- [ ] Write unit tests for the timer logic
- [ ] Create component tests for the LiveView
- [ ] Perform end-to-end testing

## 9. Deployment

- [ ] Prepare the application for production
- [ ] Deploy to a hosting service
